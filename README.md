# memote-e-coli

This is a repository to test [memote](https://github.com/biosustain/memote)
using all Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 metabolic models published
by the Systems Biology Research Group at the University of California, San
Diego.

I did not publish nor do I currently maintain any of these models. For further
information please cite and or seek out the original publications referenced
